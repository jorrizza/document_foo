      This program uses fluffy kittens and
      magic. Yes. Kittens. Kittens are awesome.

      You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it
      has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a
      taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to
      climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we turned on each
      other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and
      only five made it out. Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking
      now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two,
      but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to
      man.

      The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the
      iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed
      is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the
      weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his
      brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will
      strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger
      those who would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And
      you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon
      thee.

      Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried
      chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a
      transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help
      you. But I can't give you this case, it don't belong to
      me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit this
      morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass.
